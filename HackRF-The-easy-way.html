<meta name="description" content="The StoryRecently many different radio hacks (mousejack, drone hijacking) have hit the internet. This has spurred my interest in analogoue and digital radio.

Enter the HackRF One from Great Scott Gadgets.Now wanting to get up and running with this device ASAP I followed the recommendation from Michael Ossmann https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/1/ and downloaded Pentoo Linux.

First off new inexpensive laptops now all come with Windows 10 … I like to keep that around for convenience. So I shrunk the partition and started the install of Pentoo.

Solution: Troubleshooting reboot to UEFI device from Windows EVERY TIME, then crash the boot process with USB drive, then the BIOS will let you select an OS from the MBR … so bloody painful!Finally I am logged into Pentoo … no network … and video keeps crapping out.
