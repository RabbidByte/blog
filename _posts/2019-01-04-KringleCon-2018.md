## Summary

SANS puts on KringleCon and I have to say not only was it fun but some of it really made me think.  I made it to the end of this one but yet once again … I am writing this way, way after it has been completed so the content is going to lack.  Sorry in advance.

So some of the “challenges” that were in KringleCon were trivial and I never took notes thinking that I was never going to write about it.  So looking through what I do have saved I will just give some quick summaries on what I have.

Nope.  I just looked at the files again, and there is going to be no way I can put this one back together.  So I will give a list of the challenges that I recorded and some images.  This write up should go down in history as the worst, oh well.
